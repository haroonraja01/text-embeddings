      "The streaming rate of data in many contemporary applications can be high enough that\n",
      "a single processor cannot finish an iteration of existing methods for eigenvector estimation\n",
      "before a new sample arrives. This paper formulates and analyzes a distributed variant of\n",
      "the classical Krasulina’s method (D-Krasulina) that can keep up with the high streaming\n",
      "rate of data by distributing the computational load across multiple processing nodes. The\n",
      "analysis improves upon the one in (Balsubramani et al., 2013) for the original Krasulina’s\n",
      "method and shows that—under appropriate conditions—D-Krasulina converges to the prin-\n",

      "all nodes, its estimation error can beO(1/M). In order to reduce the network communica-\n",
      "tion overhead, the paper also develops and analyzes a mini-batch extension of D-Krasulina,\n",
      "which is termed DM-Krasulina. The analysis of DM-Krasulina shows that it can also achieve\n",
      "order-optimal estimation error rates under appropriate conditions, even when some samples\n",
      "have to be discarded within the network due to communication latency. Finally, experiments\n",
